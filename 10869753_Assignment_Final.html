<p>Hi, I am Ransford Gyasi. I am currently studying IT in Level 200 in the University of Ghana, having graduated from Achimota Senior High School. I just turned 19 on the 21st of October last year.  My father is a retired banker, but is an  acting judge. My mom, a nurse. They both love their profession.</p>

We are two brothers and two sisters. Being the eldest, I am the most responsible for my brothers and sisters. I am in charge to guide and take care of my other siblings. Cubing is my passion. I am an avid reader of fictional books as well. My favourite being Dune.

<p>I have a keen interest in video gaming too. I rarely use my personal computer and Mobile device for games, but I own a PS5 gaming console. I love to value my time for the good of my future. Friends often reflect who you are as a person. In fact, the circle of friends you chose to stay with, does define your personality and priorities. I am fortunate enough to have the best ever friends in my company.</p>

Tessy is my best friend. Though shes moved to another country, we still keep in touch almost everyday. She studies Biochemical Engineering in Canada

<p>I love time management and discipline in life. I have learned all of these value from my parents. My father is my true inspiration. He has groomed me like himself. I am quite inspired by him and that has been the single aim of my life to serve the people selflessly, as my father does.

Time is quite a precious commodity. One should exercise minimum care in utilizing one’s time. I have learned throughout all the years of my life, the good value of time and discipline. I love having the time management, sound strategy and clear cut goals in the life.</p>

<p>My life is full of experiments and achievements. I have got success many times and many times I have failed also. This all has truly taught me the importance of rising again and strike again. I continue to update myself to be the better version of myself. Although no one can be described in a few set of sentences. One need to have though command of oneself before going to write something about his life. That’s to say my life has become what is,  an essence of all of my achievements and struggles. </p>
